Reaper's Coast Rogue Vendor
=======
This mod add a new Trader for Rogue Skillbooks and Items. Mirror Papa Trash in case ... something... happened to him like in my game. I found myself without Rogue Skillbooks vendor for part of the midgame and I wanted to rectify this. It is a very simple mod I made to familiarize myself with the Editor and I thought I would share.

For now this mod is only available on the Nexus since I have to game on GOG.
